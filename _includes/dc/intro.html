  This workshop is organised by the <a href="https://www.scienceparkstudygroup.info/">Amsterdam Science Park Study Group</a>, a local community of computational biologists working at the University of Amsterdam and the <a href="https://dsc.uva.nl/">Data Science Center from the University of Amsterdam</a>. This workshop has benefited from the collaboration of instructors from the <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries Foundation</a> operating at academic institutions across the Netherlands.  <br>
  Eva Lekkerker (Digital Skills Coordinator, Data Science Center, UvA) and Tijs Bliek (SILS, Faculty of Science, UvA) will jointly act as the lead instructors. We are very grateful to Anita Schurch from the Utrecht University Medical Center for hosting this workshop.<br><br>
  
  <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a> develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. For more information on what we teach and why, please see our paper
